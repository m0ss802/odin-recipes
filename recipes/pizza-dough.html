        <h2>Fast, Crispy, and Elevated At-Home Pizza Dough</h2>
        <p>This thin-crust pizza dough doesn't require a lot of time to make, yet it has an elevated texture and flavor for at-home pizza. The crispiness and texture is best complimented with a pizza stone or steel.</p>
        <p>Best of all, this dough doesn't require a rise! Because of that, this is a really amazing fast and <em>delicious</em> weeknight dinner.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 110 degree F water to a bowl. Stir in yeast and sugar. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, 5-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth. This is probably fast for seasoned kneaders, but it usually takes me at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into a 12" circle.</li>
            <li>Bake at 500 degrees for 8-10 minutes. A pizza stone or steel is highly recommended, and you should follow the proper instructions for preheating with your chosen equipment.</li>
        </ol>
