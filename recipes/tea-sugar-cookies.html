        <h2>Simple and Satisfying Year-Round</h2>
        <p>This sugar cookie recipe is perfectly customizable for every occasion. It's a great option during the holidays, but you can easily swap out any kind of tea you'd like to suit any season or occasion.</p>
        <p>I prefer to make these cookies with Earl Grey tea, but I know chai is an extremely popular option. I think most teas would work well, but you should be aware of flavor pairings. I also prefer to use loose leaf tea, but if you're more of a bagged tea person that works well too!</p>
